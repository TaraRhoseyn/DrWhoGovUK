# Dr Who as a Govt Service

This repo and website is intended purely for education purposes. I wanted to understand the GOV.UK Frontend Package, and what better way than to answer the question 'What would Dr Who look like as a government service?'

An age-old question, indeed.

I've chosen to focus on the 10th incarnation of the doctor, not least because he's my personal favourite, but to also celebrate his recent return (as of writing 4/11/22).

Allons-y!

## Some timey-wimey, techy-wechy stuff

This website is made possible through the following technologies:
-  GOV.UK Frontend Package and Design System

My huge thanks to the [Government Digital Service](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/) for creating a package that makes working with their [Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) a breeze.

- OpenAI's ChatGPT

ChatGPT created 90% of the content you can read on the website.

## Improvements to make

- The original intention of this project was to utilize Nunjucks and Gulp to make creating and maintaining the HTML content easier. This proved a more difficult task than first realised. But using templates for this project going forward is the long-term goal.
- There's always room for more content!
