# Dr Who as a Govt Service

This repo and website is intended purely for education purposes. I wanted to understand the GOV.UK Frontend Package, and what better way than to answer the question 'What would Dr Who look like as a government service?'

An age-old question, indeed.

I've chosen to focus on the 10th incarnation of the doctor, not least because he's my personal favourite, but to also celebrate his recent return (as of writing 4/11/22).

Allons-y!
